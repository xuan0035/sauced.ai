### Example Expert Assistant
 
## This chat example is a barebones example of how you can create a simple chat agent
## and connect to agentverse. In this example we will be prompting the ASI:One model to
## answer questions on a specific subject only. This acts as a simple placeholder for
## a more complete agentic system.
##
 
# the subject that this assistant is an expert in
subject_matter = "finding recipes to meet nutrition goals while considering dietary restrictions, flavor preferences, budget, skill level, and kitchen tools"
